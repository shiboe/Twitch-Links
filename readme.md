# Twitch Links
Monitor all links in twitch chat and serve them to you in a managable list, so you can stop playing duck hunt in chat spam

## Usage
Install the plugin in your chrome, and links will start populating as they are posted to chat. Repeat posts are ignored. Links will persist for 3 minutes with an indicator bar
on the remaining lifespan of the link. Links can be saved and hidden, which adds them
to a respective tabbed list. Saved links can be accessed at any time on the saved list
but are otherwise unchanged. Hidden links are removed from the main list.

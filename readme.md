# Twitch Links
Monitor all links in twitch chat and serve them to you in a managable list, so
you can stop playing duck hunt in chat spam

## Usage
Install the plugin in your chrome, and links will start populating as they are
posted to chat. Repeat posts are consolidated, and refresh the listing. Links
will persist for 15 minutes with an indicator bar on the remaining lifespan.
Links can be saved and hidden, which adds them to a respective tabbed list to
be managed as needed. Hidden links are dropped to the bottom of the main list
and greyed out.

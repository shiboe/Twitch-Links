# Twitch Links
Monitor all links in twitch chat, and serve them to you in a managable list, so you can stop trying to catch-click links zipping by in spam.

## Usage
Install the plugin in your chrome, and links will start populating as they are posted to chat. Repeat posts are ignored. Clicking the down arrow moves a link to the ignored list to make keeping track of links you've already seen easier. You can move it back up with the up arrow button next to the ignored link. You can also filter the links, or clear them all to start over.
